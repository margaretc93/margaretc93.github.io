			<td class="bio">
        <p>Born in December of 1993, coinciding with the birth of her all-time favourite idol, Taylor Swift, Elly was raised with art all around her. Art, and cats. Cats she taught to play fetch. Creator of many awesome of inside jokes and reader of some questionable fan-fiction, she now studies her Illustration degree in Bournemouth University.</p>
        <br>
				<p>I don't know. SHE ILLUSTRATES THINGS. SHE DOES IT WELL. Her eyebrows are bomb as. She cried really hard at the end of Toy Story 3. She's also a roller-derby queen	and she loves cats. But who doesn't!? All in all, her artsiness is just one of the amazing qualities Elly happens to possess.</p>
